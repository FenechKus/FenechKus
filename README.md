<h3 align="center">💁‍♂️ About me </h3>
<div>
  Hi! I am an emerging software developer. I am studying such areas as server and application software development. I know C# well and a little less C++. I also sometimes like to get into a completely different language to see how you can do the same task in different programming languages. I am a student of the Volzhsky Polytechnic Institute in the field of Software Engineering. I also have a technical education and am a certified programmer. I just like learning hehe 😊
